        <h2>Calculator Project</h2>
        <p>I started my calculator project on a plane bound for Seattle Washington. The funny thing was I worked on it
            for an hour and then got stuck because I couldn’t get the calculator grid to show up at all and had no
            internet on the plane to look up the issue. When I landed in Seattle that night I found out that the issue
            was that I forgot to link my style sheet to my HTML page *facepalm*. After that silly mishap, I got to work
            on all of the functions and made the operator functions… functional. From there, things went smoothly and I
            was able to add keyboard controls, added exponent notation after the number got too large, and styled it to
            look like the iPhone calculator. The smallest brain thing I did throughout this project was making the
            percent button edit the string that was in the input box. This took a lot of lines of code and many a splice
            method when all I needed to do was divide the current number by 100. In the end, I was incredibly happy with
            my project and might add more functionality in the future if I’m ever feeling uninspired.</p>

        <h2>Job Shadow</h2>
        <p>A little over 6 months ago I had the pleasure of going on a job shadow with a project manager at my current
            place of employment, Tommy car wash systems. I went to work learning how to read building plans and
            researching how I could reach my goal of becoming a project manager. Reading blueprints without being able
            to apply that skill got boring quickly and to improve my skills in my current role I took a Udemy course on
            Microsoft Excel. Towards the end of that course, there was a small section on Visual Basic which triggered
            an interest in programming. Then I bought a python course on Udemy. Since then I’ve completed most of the
            python course (skipped the specific python related stuff) and opted to learn JavaScript to pursue front-end
            web development. Just recently I was allowed to go on another job shadow within the company I work at. I
            shadowed our web developer for half the day then one of our software developers. It was a fantastic day and
            it gave me a lot of perspective on where I can improve. I realized that I have a lot of room to grow before
            I can call myself a software developer, but I also found that I’m closer to securing a front-end web
            developer job than I had thought. The job shadow instilled motivation in me to continue learning and
            striving for career improvement. If you ever have a chance to do a job shadow for a position you hope to
            reach I advise you to take the opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>The only learning that I did that wasn’t related to solving bugs in projects was on object-oriented
            programming in javascript. I never truly grasped OOP when learning python and when learning about objects it
            made a lot more sense this time around. I’ll end up learning more about this over the next couple of weeks.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JS well isn’t easy. I am having a lot of fun improving my skills in all
            three though and I don’t see myself stopping anytime soon. Thank you for reading!</p>
